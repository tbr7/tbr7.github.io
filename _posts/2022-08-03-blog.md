## August 3, 2022
Slow to wake up this morning after going for a [fun run](https://www.strava.com/activities/7569409902) yesterday morning on the Goucher loop I explored on 8/1. Didn't run very long, but enjoyed jumping over trees and exploring the woods.
I think even just this little bit of exercise helped me feel good yesterday (even if it wasn't terribly 'work productive'). I made some delicious Korean banchans yesterday thanks to one of my favorite food bloggers, [Korean Bapsang](https://www.koreanbapsang.com/).
I made some delicious 깍두기 (kkakdugi) which is cubed radish kimchi and 콩나 (Kongnamul) which is a crunchy soybean sprout side dish. Cooking always makes me feel less stressed. I think cooking feels a bit like adult Legos where I can turn off my brain to the outside world and just follow some instructions for a while to create something fun.
 
Today I'm doing my usual work, taking Murph for a walk in his sushi bandana, and completing my daily Leetcode grind. I hope to make it to bed early today so I can be in shared productive company with Diana tomorrow morning while she studies for [Step 3](https://www.usmle.org/step-exams/step-3).
### Leetcode 567 - Permutation in String (Medium)
I enjoyed working on this [solution](https://github.com/tbr7/lc/blob/main/567.py). It was a fun problem for me because I enjoy a problem where there are many solutions depending on how much things can be optimized. Since I'm working through Sliding Window patterns, I knew this problem would be some order of O(N) where I shouldn't waste time. Surprisingly, I'm getting a little better at coding something and hitting "Test", then seeing it work right away. I know that just using a HashMap or two and doing a Sliding Window isn't too hard, but it feels good to come up with the solution semi-easily on my own. I would love to do something like this problem in an interview.
