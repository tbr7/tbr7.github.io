## August 5, 2022
Out of bed by 5:45! Strong start to the morning by getting some natural sunlight exposure by walking Murph around the neighborhood. I was listening to Tim Ferris with Andrew Huberman about how to get better sleep and sunlight first thing in the morning stuck with me as an easy win.

> The simple behavior that I do believe everybody should adopt… is to view, ideally sunlight, for 2–10 minutes every morning upon waking. So, when you get up in the morning, you want to get bright light into your eyes because it does two things.

I enjoyed my brief sunlight walk and then got home to make some coffee before joining Diana for a study session! TGIF, looking forward to finishing some work today and then relaxing on the weekend
 
 
### Leetcode 30 - Substring with Concatenation of All Words (Hard)
I completed my last Sliding Window problem for a while this morning. This was a fun problem to work on, but got tripped up a little bit about the best way to iterate for substrings. I tunnel-visioned a little bit on the idea of needing to keep a `start` variable when doing a problem like this, but once I realized the benefits of all words to match having the same length I was able to figure this one out and reproduce it. As usual, I started by keeping a frequency counter for the words I was trying to find in the larger string. By recognizing that there are only so many windows that you can check for in the larger string, the number of iterations becomes the key to solving this problem. I iterated the length of the large string minus the window size (wordLen * wordCount) + 1 to account for the last or first iteration. By keeping track of the `seen` words for each substring, this problem was trivial since any non-word substring breaks the iteration, or seeing something too many times breaks the loop. Felt good to finish the problem to start the day.


```
 def findSubstring(self, s: str, words: List[str]) -> List[int]:
    wordLen = len(words[0])
    wordCount = len(words)
    if wordCount == 0 or wordLen == 0:
        return []
    
    # Keep the frequency of every word in a HashMap
    wordFreq = {}
    for w in words:
        if w not in wordFreq:
            wordFreq[w] = 0
        wordFreq[w] += 1
        

    indices = []
    # Starting from every index in the string, try to match all the words.
    # since we know wordLen, we know how many String chars are needed to be possible
    # example catfoxcat, ["cat", "fox"] the min window is 2 words * 3 wordLen  = 6 chars
    # 9 chars in S, window = 6 chars, so can only iterate 4 times
    # catfox, atfoxc, tfoxca, foxcat
    for i in range((len(s) - wordCount * wordLen) + 1):
        # In each iteration, keep track of all the words that we have already seen in another map.
        seen = {}
        for j in range(wordCount):
            nextWordIndex = i + j * wordLen
            word = s[nextWordIndex:nextWordIndex+wordLen]
            
            # word is not found, move to next char in the string.
            if word not in wordFreq:
                break
                
            if word not in seen:
                seen[word] = 0
            seen[word] += 1
            
            # higher frequency than required, move to next char in string
            if seen[word] > wordFreq[word]:
                break
                
            # Store the start index if we have found all the words.
            if j + 1 == wordCount:
                indices.append(i)
    return indices
```
