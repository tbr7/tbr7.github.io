Hi, I'm Tom! I'm a software engineer at FAANG. I'm writing a blog as I start trying my hand at advancing my career by improving my tech and writing skills. I just left San Francisco to be with my girlfriend for her medical residency, and I'll be back in New York for 2023 and beyond.
 
I've created this blog to hold myself accountable for improvement. In 2020 I ran every single day for a total of 3408 miles, but I couldn't have done that without logging all of my runs to my friends on [Strava](https://www.strava.com/activities/4546229804).
