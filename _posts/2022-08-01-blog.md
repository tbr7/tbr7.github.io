## August 1, 2022
On this cool Monday morning, I started the day bright and early at 6 am. I didn't want to leave bed today, but I got out of bed and onto the couch to do some light fiction reading of Ready Player Two. Not as good as Ready Player One, but I find it still pretty whimsical. I enjoy the escapism of reading compared to where I spend the rest of my independent hobby time (League of Legends). I've been playing LoL since late 2017, but lately my girlfriend and I have been noticing it just makes days go by far too fast. Reading is nice because it slows things down.
 
I took an awesome walk with [Murph](https://photos.app.goo.gl/17uFzAFJcVkxF6Ws5) today through Goucher college. There's an awesome 2.5-mile loop that I found on [AllTrails](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/maryland/goucher-college-campus-loop) today. It was a bit muddy, so we only did a short stint. Murphy got dirty, but at least we avoided ticks today after shaking one out of his fur last week.
 
### Leetcode 424 - Longest Repeating Character Replacement (Medium)
Today's problem was another sliding window problem as I work my way through the first pattern of [Grokking the Coding Interview: Patterns for Coding Questions](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-coding-interview). For me, the hardest part of this question was figuring out how to keep track of the max frequency. I watched a [Neetcode.io YouTube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqXU1UyA8pk) explaining his process. I felt stuck when I had a hard time keeping track of the max frequency of characters and I found that discouraging, but I liked the way that he states that you can move forward with a more brute force check of the most frequent character in O(26) aka O(N) time which isn't all that bad. When I hear something like this, it helps me get unstuck. Eventually, I was able to figure out that I could keep track of the max frequency the whole way along without having to decrement which was helpful.
 
### Progress
I didn't do any LC yesterday, but I'm hoping that as I start to write more and blog I might fall into flow more often and enjoy this process. Ultimately, I know most of this long game is about making things sustainable, so baby steps are important. I'll consider today a win as I kick off another work day where I hope to get unstuck on CloudFormation/CDK changes.
