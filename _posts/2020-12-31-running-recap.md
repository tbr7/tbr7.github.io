### 2020 By The Numbers

* 3408 Miles (avg 9.31 miles/day)
* 126,731 feet of elevation
* Highest 7 Day Total: 112 Miles
* 354 Days of Running Solo
* 2:46:00 Marathon
* 401 hours of running
* 62 Runs Started @ 11:56pm or later

Feel so happy accomplishing my goal this year. I know everyone had their battle with 2020, so I'm feeling thankful that my body allowed me to run every day (even if sometimes it was just for a desperate mile shuffle at 11:59 pm). I'm physically and mentally exhausted, but I learned so much is possible if you just set your mind to something and put in a little effort every single day.

Some of my family asked me what I'm planning on doing for my goal in 2021, but I think I'm going to try to stay away from streaks as they cause mental and physical strain sometimes. I think I'll stick to trying to figure out a healthy, balanced workout routine that works for me. I’d like to maybe even develop a healthy sleep schedule! I loved the accountability that Strava provided since I knew people would see if I broke the streak, but I learned about halfway through that I was doing this for myself. Some days I was way too worried about what other people were thinking regarding how far or how fast I ran (even though nobody else would have even noticed). With that said, I'm going to take about a week off of running and a break from Strava until I know I can come back with a healthy attitude where I'm just happy with my exercise regardless of Kudos and views.
Thanks so much to one or two people that may get to this point in this post. I really couldn't have made this goal a reality without the support and cheers from you. Some days I wanted to quit, but I knew my friends and family would be there to cheer me on. Feeling incredibly proud knowing I kicked 2020's ass and looking forward to 2021 knowing I can handle anything it throws at me. ✌️
